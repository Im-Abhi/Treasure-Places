## About the app

- The main goal of this app is to help users to share their favourite places with others.
- The app uses [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/apis-by-platform) to get the loaction of places entered by users.
- Google Maps API provides google maps which can be embedded in the website with target location and we can also extract the geo-coordinates of the location.

## About MERN-Stack

MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, Node, after the four key technologies that make up the stack.

- MongoDB - document database
- Express(.js) - Node.js web framework
- React(.js) - a client-side JavaScript framework
- Node(.js) - the premier JavaScript web server

Express and Node make up the middle (application) tier. Express.js is a server-side web framework, and Node.js the popular and powerful JavaScript server platform. Regardless of which variant you choose, ME(RVA)N is the ideal approach to working with JavaScript and JSON, all the way through.
